v1.4.0
------
1st August, 2016

There have have been *so many* changes since the last formal update to this package, that
it is almost pointless to list them. v1.4.0 is the first version to support hmf v2+, and
be well modularised. There are still several things that need doing reasonably urgently,
so I assume that several versions will follow rather rapidly. Tests have been performed
against other codes for this version, though they have not been formally included yet.
