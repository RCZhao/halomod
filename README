THIS IS THE README FOR hod
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

hod is a python application that provides a flexible and simple interface for 
dealing with the Halo Model of Dark Matter Halos. It comes with several HOD 
models, halo density profiles, bias models and Mass Function models (through 
hmf, by the same people).

For a given choice of parameters (for each of the above models), it can 
calculate the large-scale structure correlation function. In the future,we hope 
to be able to use it "in reverse". That is, given a correlation function, be 
able to compute the HOD model.


INSTALLATION
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
---- Install Requirements ------
1. Install Python
2. Install all dependencies of hmf (see readme for hmf).
	
---- Install hod --------------
    >>> pip install hod [soon will implement this, for now, grab this source
    					 and use "python setup.py install"]
    					 
USAGE
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
hod can be used interactively (for instance in ipython) or in a script. 
To use interactively, in ipython do something like the following:

>>> from hod import HOD
>>> h = HOD()
>>> galcorr = h.corr_gal
>>> bias = h.bias.bias
>>> ...

All parameters to HOD() have defaults so none must be specified. There are 
quite a few that CAN be specified however. Check the docstring to see the
details. Furthermore, as hod extends the functionality of hmf, almost all
parameters accepted by hmf.Perturbations() can be used (check its docstring). 
The exception is cut_fit, which is necessarily set to False in hod. 

To change the parameters (cosmological or otherwise), one should use the 
update() method, if a HOD() object already exists. For example
 >>> h = HOD()
 >>> h.update(r=np.linspace(0.1,1,1000)) #update scale vector
 >>> corr_2h = h.corr_gal_2h #The 2-halo term of the galaxy correlation function

One can access any of the properties of the Perturbations() class for the 
given parameters through the pert attribute of HOD:

 >>> h = HOD()
 >>> mass_variance = h.pert.sigma
 >>> mass_function = h.pert.dndlnm
